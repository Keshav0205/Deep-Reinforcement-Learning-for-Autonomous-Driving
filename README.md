# Deep-Reinforcement-Learning-for-Autonomous-Driving
This repository contains my implementation of Deep Reinforcement Learning using Deep Neural Networks for autonomous vehicle's control and behaviorial navigation in the CARLA Simulator. </br>
1. **dqn_utils.py**: This Python file contains the classes - Sensors, DQNetwork, Memory and Sumtree. These are required for creating, modifying and adding/deletig the memory instances along with the Deep Neural Network.
2. **dqn_functions_extra.py**: This Python file contains some auxilliary functions for the training and other operations. For the sake of easy access and reduced complexity and length of the code, I have collected all the functions here.
3. **dqn_params.py**: This Python file contains the hyperparameters related to the memory buffer, neural network and the reinforcement learning agent.
